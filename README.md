A pretty simple (and currently incomplete) incremental game using only Javascript, CSS, and HTML5.

After an intense bootcamp learning React, Redux databases via Sequelize and PostGreSQL, I wanted to go back to basics, and work out a rather 'simple' game in order to hone and solidify my vanilla Javascript skills. I've always wanted to create an incremental game, after having spent lazy summer days playing through them, and with most of them being open sourced, and vanilla Javascript themselves, the opportunity presented itself.
