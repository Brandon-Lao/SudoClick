# Code Clicker: An Undertaking of HTML5, Javascript, and CSS

React.js. Express, using Sequelize. Redux, React-Redux.

Components, eager loading, dynamically updating, store. Powerful tools.

Libraries and node modules capable of next to anything you can think of.

But useless without a good base.



Incremental games are many things, but the three most relevant are this:
1. They're mostly open source.
2. They're expansive, at least more recent ones. Go from a simple idler to a pseudo-roguelike, just like that.
3. They only use HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.


And with this, makes the perfect project in order to hone such skills. Working with React has been fun, but meant
that the nitty-gritty of the code tends to get unnoticed or brushed aside, not to mention the complete lack of anything
to do with CSS.


The purpose of this project is use those three languages, and ONLY those three languages, to construct an incremental game
similar to ones already on the web, such as Universal Paperclips, a dark room, Candy Box(2), and Cookie Clicker.
