# THINGS TO DO:

+ Implement upgrades on the currently existing buildings.
+ Add in a different resource independent of the current loop.
+ Allow log to have at least five lines of logging, updating whenever we get stuff.
+ Ability to add in different modules to do different things.

+ Set things into different script files

# THINGS TO NOTE/LEARN:

+ Using canvas in order to create animations
+ Figure out some way to make incrementing faster?

# IDEAS FOR LATER ELEMENTS:

+ Stock market:
  + Use canvas to animate it, randomly goes up or down plus manipulation values?

+ Side Scroller:
  + Should automatically move left-to-right (or simulate it), detect collisions, etc.
  + Currently only can move/down, automatically simulates left-right movement. Colissions are an arse, x and y in the playarea are mixed up.
  + Needs integration with the main resources and the like: getting cash should change the cash var, etc.

# CURRENT TALKABLE PROBLEMS:

A. HTML/Javascript accepts everything. .innterHTML? That's fine. Array overflowing? That's fine.
B. Write out EVERY case. There's a lot to be considered.
