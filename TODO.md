<!-- You know I'm starting to realize that this project is literally the exact opposite of what Stackathon's supposed to be.
Learn a new code, library, or feature? Nope, reinforces and goes through the most basics of languages we've learned.
Have an MPV that's hard, but eventually reachable? Nope. MPV takes 15 minutes to code. The rest? Oof. -->

# THINGS TO DO:

+ Implement upgrades on the currently existing buildings.
+ Add in a different resource independent of the current loop.
+ Allow log to have at least five lines of logging, updating whenever we get stuff.
+ Ability to add in different modules to do different things.

+ Set things into different script files

+ 

# THINGS TO NOTE/LEARN:

+ Using canvas in order to create animations
+ Figure out some way to make incrementing faster?

# IDEAS FOR LATER ELEMENTS:

+ Stock market:
  + Use canvas to animate it
  + Price goes up or down depending on profits, you personally re-buying or selling your own stock, etc.
  + Can use resources to influence stock price and cause it to fall or rise back up

+ Side Scroller:
  + Should automatically move left-to-right (or simulate it), detect collisions, etc.
  + Needs integration with the main resources and the like: getting cash should change the cash var, etc.
  + Upgrades should be able to influence.

# CURRENT TALKABLE PROBLEMS:

A. HTML/Javascript accepts everything. .innterHTML? That's fine. Array overflowing? That's fine.
B. Write out EVERY case. There's a lot to be considered.
